to do:
 * handle resizing somehow
   - In the settings, there will be entry "max minefield size"
   - The actual minefield size will be the smallest of "max minefield size" and
     "available screen size"
   - When user resizes window, minesweeper must handle this somehow - at least
     resize the internal window objects not to fall out of screen and throw
     error.
   - The position and size of the minefield should also be updated
   - If the minefield size changes, there is no way of continuing the game
   - Therefore, the most "game-preserving" option seems:
     ~ If there is a game running and the available space increases:
           keep the minefield at current size, resize after restart
     ~ If there is a game running and the available space schrinks:
           pause the game, summon a dialog, asking the user to kindly enlarge
           the window back. Otherwise, the game will be terminated.
     ~ If the game is not running (either fresh or post-game):
           delete the minefield, resize and create new, adapted to the new size
